I walked in the door Monday excited but nervous.  What will the instructors be like?  Since I expect to be spending a majority of my wakeful hours with the other students, did gSchool do a good job of weeding out the assholes?

Turns out, there are 25 really nice, motivated *(and fun)* future Ruby developers I'll get to know *(very well)* over the next six months.

Looking forward to learning as much as possible to kick off my **new career!**
