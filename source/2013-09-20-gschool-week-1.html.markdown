Week 1's main focus was Event Reporter.  The idea here is to combine the major concepts of Event Manager, Encryptor and MicroBlogger into a single project.  This is also the first project that was not spoon fed in the tutorial.  Event Reporter is a super basic terminal app that can load a file, and print or save data based on some basic search criteria.  *Easy*, right?

Testing was also introduced before the project, so the goal was to try wearing your *Test Driven Design* big boy pants.

Cue **Frustration**.

The first few days were some of the most frustrating days of the class so far.  My project partner George and I were still learning some basic concepts that make this project possible.  To make matters worse, knowing that a lot of the functionality was similar to Event Manager, we used my version of Event Manager to begin.  This idead would have worked flawlessly if my Event Manager actually worked.

If you like crap, then you can see my craptastic version of Event Manager [here](https://github.com/bwinterling/event_reporter).

One really tough part of banging your head against a wall was that I didn't see my wife and kids for three days.  Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday all ended some time after 10pm.  This is not a recipe for marital bliss.  I'll have to figure out a way to balance this better going forward.

George has to pick up his daughters from school, and would grind away at night, and we would reconnect in the morning and share ideas.

The highlight of the project for me was Wednesday night.  I was about ready to go into the alley and scream at the top of my lungs.  Instead, I asked a few different people about classes, instance variables, getters and setters.  The best talk was with Frank, who explained that bad touches are bad.  I didn't sleep much that night, thinking about Frank's bad touches -- but it finally **clicked** for me.

Thursday morning, George and I basically rebuilt the entire project in about five hours.  Go figure.

The new and improved version is [here](https://github.com/bwinterling/event_reporter2).

I have some ideas how to start from a test-driven perspective next time.  Try to sketch out the logic structure first, which will help guide the initial layout and where you can find the results to actually test.  We'll see how it goes on Monday!

I also learned how helpful the rest of my classmates are.  Couldn't have done it without them.  I also hope I was able to help my classmates in return.
