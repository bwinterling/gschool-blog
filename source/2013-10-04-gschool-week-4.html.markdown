Week 4 marked the wrap up of the Sales Engine project.  Having a beer at one of the many Gather happy hours, a developer from RentBits asked what the project entailed.  I explained that using Ruby, we turned a bunch of CSV files into objects, then created methods to perform business logic on those objects.  His response, "Cool.  That's pretty much what I do every day, but in Java and Grails."

Fun to know that in four short weeks, we are already doing some real world development.  Can't wait to see what I'm capable of at the conclusion of the program.  If I were to guess now, I'd say I should be able to create a fully functioning product, from front end all the way to the database, with a complete set of test scripts. Sprinkle in a little JavaScript and hopefully a few other interesting things.  Feels good to be challenged.

This project also marked a change in my programming style.  I've started breaking down my logic into really tiny pieces, with a method defining each step.  In the past, I sometimes tried to do too much within a single method, making it difficult to keep track of what was happening and even more challenging to trouble shoot when things went wrong.  This project feels very clear, easy to read and understand, and very simple to verify.

Working in pairs can present an interesting challenge.  For this project, my partner and I were on fairly different levels of understanding.  I found it hard to balance my desire to truly work as a team and the knowledge that the project has a due date.  Helping my partner learn really solidified my understanding of Ruby, but also slowed down my productivity.  But working with my partner was a lot of fun.  I also think the focus was on learning more than delivering a finished product, so in that sense, mission accomplished.
