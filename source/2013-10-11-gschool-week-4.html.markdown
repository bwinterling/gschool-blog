This past week was labeled "Focus Week".  Really just a chance to take a breather from deadline driven projects and learn some new skills (or sharpen old ones).  Turned out to be a really fun week.  Nathaniel and I worked on building a few games in Ruby Processing.  We built a tic-tac-toe game and put together a decent start on a backgammon game.

*I also spent some time with my seven year old daughter creating a cookie decorating app.  She had a blast and I think she enjoyed seeing what I was learning in school.  I want her to not be afraid of computers and programming, so I might seek out some other projects for us to work on.*

Frank discussed the MVC model for structuring projects, and we put that to work in our games.  All in all, a fun week to keep working in Ruby, and to think more conceptually about how we build our programs.

Working with Nathaniel, who has a similar skill level, was also refreshing. We were able to strategize about the structure of the project, crank out effective code, and complete some complex tasks really fast.  Looking back at previous pairings, working with someone of the same skill level pushes your technical skills.  Working with someone below your skill level pushes your interpersonal skills.  Both are worthwhile, and we should be pushed to develop both skill sets,  but to really take advantage of this class, pushing our technical skills should be the priority.

Next week, we kick off our first web application.  Of course, once you can see an application in a browser, it feels like more of an actual product.  Looking forward to sharpening my HTML/CSS skills and tying it all together.
