Ever tried to maintain a long distance relationship?  It's hard.  Easier if the relationship started in person, so the foundation is solid, but it relies on skills like talking on the phone.  Me - not a big fan - much rather speak in person.  But what if you never even met the person?  Could you build a new relationship over the phone?

This is how I feel about command-line applications.  Finally working on a web application feels like I'm finally in the same room, talking in person.

Once again, the learning curve is steep, but not insurmountable.  I killed the better part of a morning yesterday trying to install Bootstrap CSS on my Sinatra app.  I've also left my TDD practices in the dust - it feels too complex to develop effective tests when I'm not even sure what I'm doing.  Now that I have made it through the tutorial, have css up and running, and have a few extensions working - I'm going to revisit my app and set up unit tests for all the modules.  Next time I build a Sinatra app, I'll be able to start with TDD from the beginning.

Working on an individual project has been fun this time around.  I can groove and take the project in any direction I want (like adding CSS) without worrying about my partner's learning.  Short of the Encryptor project, I haven't had a partner who could answer questions, so working alone is no different when I need help - I still need to formulate my question and seek help from someone else.

And, on a unrelated note, I've had this (http://youtu.be/Pi7gwX7rjOw "song") stuck in my head all morning.  Enjoy!
