I'm going to tackle this retrospective using the LIFO method.  On Friday, we had a code retreat.  To shake things up and code in a new environment, we left our usual trendy, modern workspace behind and brought our 27+ person entourage to a trendy, modern non-workspace.

I liked the location - we had access to some good eats and tasty beverages.  But I'd say give the students several weeks notice before the next retreat and see how creative we can get in brianstorming some truly unusual workspaces.

The code retreat itself was cool.  While starting off pretty basic, we quickly moved into some uncharted territory with some challenging pairing techniques.  No if/while/case statements.  No talking.  One line at a time.  My only complaint would be the time constraints.  The sessions would come to an end each just as we were hitting our strides and were about to tackle the really hard stuff.  There's a certain amount of setup that takes place for each exercise, which only leaves the last 10 minutes or so for pushing your boundaries.  So my suggestion for next time would be to extend the sessions by ten minutes and eliminate the early warm up rounds.

**IdeaBox**

Our project for the week was IdeaBox.  This was our first foray into creating web applications using Sinatra.  Having only focused on Ruby and related testing techniques for the last seven weeks, this week pushed us into new territory with YAML, MVC structure, HTTP, integration/application testing and HTML/CSS/ERB.

Since web applications are new to me, I focused on learning the concepts in the tutorial and left testing for last.  I found the tutorial did not explain itself very well and I was just following along.  The answer to 'why' in many cases was not evident until I began working on the extensions and had to build my own logic from scratch.  From there, it started moving pretty quickly.  Early on, I added Bootstrap and worked hard at using layouts and partials to simplify my code.  I was also able to help a number of folks with their CSS integration and trouble shooting.

For our upcoming Sinatra project, I'm going to focus on application and integration testing, setting up ENV's to handle testing vs production and thinking more critically about the goals of the project.

This week is also Halloween, which, with two super-imaginative sugar-loving kids, is kind of a big deal.  My challenge will be balancing project time with all the fun activities lined up for my kids this week.  I'm doing my best, but I consider myself extremely lucky to have such a *supportive* wife!
