Wow.  This week flew by.  My team was cranking out code.

This week was a project called Clone Wars.  In teams of three, we were to select a static web site to copy and add functionality using Sequel, then deploy to Heroku.

We picked the most craptastic website we could find.  The 'affordable French restaurant', Le Central, apparently couldn't afford a good web designer, so we thought we could blow it out of the water.

Our team decided since we only had two and a half days to pull this off, we didn't want to spend a lot of energy trying to improve the HTML/CSS - so we quickly browsed the offers at ThemeForest.com and picked a template that looked classy enough for a restaurant that makes high quality food.  A few hours later, we had pasted most of the content from the original site into the template and had a solid starting point.

After creating the basic structure of the MVC model, and creating the controller, we were hungry.  We decided to have dinner at Le Central, and after a few glasses of wine, invited the owner to come to our presentation.  We figure we're going to build this anyway, and were confident it would be an improvement over his current site.  So...  now the pressure was on to pull this off.

My team rocked.  Kevin took some amazing pictures of the restaurant for the site, and worked some CSS magic to improve the look and feel.  I also got to work with Jonah for the first time, and found out we work quite well together.  We produce more, and better quality work than working alone.  My first true insight into the benefits of pair programming.

Overall, this was a good refresher on things we learned the week before.  Solidified knowledge of Sinatra, databases, Sequel methods and working in development / production environments.  The time contraints on this project really limited what we were able to accomplish.  With another week, we could fine tune the admin console, allowing the admin to change all sorts of things on the Menu.  Add Course subtitles.  Add reservations functionality, or a least an API to OpenTable.  Incorporate a calendar of events.  Add dynamic banners.

But...  time to move on.  Today we dive into Rails.  Can't wait!
