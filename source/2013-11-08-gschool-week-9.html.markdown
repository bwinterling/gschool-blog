Crazy to think that we'd be wrapping up the program if we went to a 'boot camp' style class.  I can't imagine I'd be ready to fully contribute - with so much to learn.  I love the fact that we dove deep into Ruby -- its becoming reflexive.  The last two weeks, we built full MVC modeled websites using just Sinatra and Ruby.

Now that we're getting started with Rails, I kind of miss the freedom that Sinatra/Ruby offered.  I can see how active record will make the backend much more effecient to write, but I find all the structure a little frustrating so far.  I know its only been a few days, so I'm sure Rails will become just as reflexive after another month of use.  Looking forward to that mastery, so I'm not thinking about where to put things and can focus on higher level concepts like security, effeciency etc...

The project for the next two weeks is called Dinner Dash.  Build a site that offers online ordering.  Starting to get the hang of it.  I'm learning how Rails treats sessions and memoization a little differently, but have that working pretty well.  A few new gems for me, like Factory Girl, Faker and OmniAuth.  This is also my first major foray into RSpec.  So far, so good.

Cheers
