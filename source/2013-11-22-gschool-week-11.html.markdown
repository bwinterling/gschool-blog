So we skipped a week there.  Let me recap.  Last week we wrapped up Dinner Dash and gave our first official product demos.  By official, I mean we presented, using actual AV technology like microphones and projectors, to people that were not classmates.

Cool project.  We basically had to create our first Rails app with no Rails training.  Good concept.  Lots of learning to be done, *the hard way*.  I will certainly have a much different perspective heading into the next project that will drastically change how I approach the project.

Next time, I would like our team to spend more time planning.  Write out the core functionality needed, draw the wireframes and map out the associated RESTful routes.  This will allow us to divide the project in a more logical way, allowing test driven development for the full stack.  

Friday we went to iTriage for a code retreat.  They were kind enough to open their doors, give us their boardroom for the day.  Feed us delicious gyros.  Pour us some tasty happy hour beers.

The project for the day was the classic game Battleship.  Pretty fun trying to figure out how to build the game from both directions (game logic vs object models).  The iterations allowed us to build some knowledge to advance the next iterations.  The only bummer is having to delete your work after 50min and start over.  Battleship requires keeping track of points on a grid, so we learned some cool ideas for creating and working with arrays.  I'm sure there are other ways.  You also had to decide where logic should be kept - in the game model or the ship model.

On to this week.  We've been diving into Javascript.  I didn't realize what an important part javascript will play in our futures.  The more I research web application development, the more omnipresent javascript is.  I've certainly come to the conclusion that to be successful in this space, I will need to know javascript as well or better than I know Ruby/Rails.  I hope that we get the opportunity to learn more over the second half of the program!

Cheers,

Brian
